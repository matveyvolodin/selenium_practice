### Homework for the 2nd lesson
You need to refactor autotests for saucedemo site: ***Site link: https://www.saucedemo.com/***.

As you remember we have already written autotests for this site. Now with the baggage of new knowledge I propose to refactor new tests:

1. Separate locators, data
2. Add fxtures
3. If possible, add pre, post conditions
4. Obtain and compare information about elements

There is no checkbox on saucedemo site so ChatGPT wrote a small registration form for you Link: https://victoretc.github.io/webelements_information/
You can also use any site that has a registration form and a checkbox.
